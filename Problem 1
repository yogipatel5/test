Given the following input values from a form, create a method or methods to validate the
input based on their requirements. Throw an exception if any data is invalid.

	- name
		-- is required
		-- must be first name AND last name

	email
		-- is required
		-- is a valid email address

	twitter
		-- is optional
		-- is a twitter handle
			--- begins with an @symbol
			--- can only contain alphanumeric characters and an underscore
			--- maximum 15 characters in length

The input data will be in the following format:

	$input = [
	'name' => '...',
	'email' => '...',
	'twitter' => '...'
	];
