Problem 4 (MySQL, PHP)

Use the schema from problem 2 and:

	- create a query for getting the total number of products and the total value for all
	orders made on the current date and the same query for orders made on the day
	before the current date (create a sample data in the database to test your solution)
	
	- create a simple php application to connect to the database and perform the
	queries
